### Description

### [Hexlet Chat](https://frontend-project-12-production-2d23.up.railway.app)

Hexlet chat is a single-page application with registration and authentication.
All user actions are tracked and processed in real-time.
There are permanent (default) channels in the chat, as well as user-created channels. Channels can also be renamed or deleted.
Each user action is accompanied by a display of notification, so the interface is as friendly as possible.
There is support for two languages (ru, en) with switching between them at any time. Also, bad words are filtered.
